# CRUD Java
# In these Java files I created a program using GUI with Java, 
# It's about a database of teacher. You can Create, Read, Update and Delete the teachers registers.
# But also is necessary have a database created called "maestros" with a table called "maestro".

# Also I used a program called "Wampserver64" to create DB.
